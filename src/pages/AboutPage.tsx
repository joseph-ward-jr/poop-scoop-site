                <p>
                Field & Foyer began as a conversation between two best friends, Joey and Robb, who shared a single belief: homeowners deserve better. We looked at the home services industry and saw a lack of personal touch and a true commitment to quality. We knew we could create a different kind of companyâ€”one founded on trust, friendship, and an uncompromisingly high standard for every task.

In 2025, we turned that vision into a reality. As a family-owned business, we bring that personal-level commitment to our clients, starting with a service fundamental to a pristine yard: premium pet waste management. Our mission is to elevate this essential service, proving that even the most necessary tasks can be performed with a boutique-like feel, absolute discretion, and an extraordinary level of care.

What starts with premium pet care is the first step on our journey. We are deliberately growing to become your single, trusted partner for complete home stewardship, soon expanding to include comprehensive lawn maintenance and meticulous indoor cleaning. As we grow, our core promise remains the same: we only accept extraordinary work from our employees, because our standards are higher than anyone else's. That is the Field & Foyer difference.
