# Why Your Backyard is Worse for Being Barefoot Than Your Bathroom

*Published on June 28, 2025 by the Field & Foyer Team*

When was the last time you walked barefoot through your bathroom? Probably never, right? Yet many of us think nothing of stepping barefoot onto our backyard grass. Here's the shocking truth: **your backyard is likely harboring more dangerous bacteria and parasites than your bathroom floor.**

## The Hidden Dangers Lurking in Your Yard

### Pet Waste: The Silent Contaminator

Even if you're diligent about picking up after your pets, invisible contamination remains. A single gram of dog waste contains:

- **23 million fecal coliform bacteria**
- **E. coli, Salmonella, and Giardia**
- **Roundworm and hookworm eggs that can survive in soil for years**
- **Parvovirus and other pathogens**

### Wild Animal Contributions

Your yard is also a highway for:
- **Raccoons** (carrying raccoon roundworm)
- **Birds** (spreading Salmonella and Campylobacter)
- **Rodents** (leaving behind Hantavirus and Leptospirosis)
- **Stray cats** (Toxoplasmosis risk)

### Environmental Factors

Unlike your bathroom, your yard faces:
- **Rain washing contaminants deeper into soil**
- **UV degradation creating concentrated toxic zones**
- **Seasonal temperature changes affecting pathogen survival**
- **No regular disinfection routine**

## Your Bathroom: Surprisingly Cleaner

Modern bathrooms benefit from:
- **Regular cleaning with disinfectants**
- **Non-porous surfaces that don't harbor bacteria**
- **Controlled environment with proper ventilation**
- **Immediate cleanup of contamination**
